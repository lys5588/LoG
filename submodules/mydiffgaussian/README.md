## Differences from Original Version

1. **Removed the 0.3 Pixel Addition in 2D Filtering**
   - The original version added an extra 0.3 pixels to 2D filtering operations. This fork removes that addition for more precise filtering.

2. **Added Functionality to Return ID of the Point Contributing Most to Each Pixel**
   - This fork introduces the ability to track and return the ID of the point that has the largest contribution to each pixel, aiding in detailed analysis.

3. **Added Feature to Return Maximum Weight Value for Each Point in the Rendered Image**
   - Now, it's possible to get the maximum weight value of each point in the image, useful for understanding point distribution and impact.
